# Outline

* Introduction - background
  * dominant migration method uncertain
      * imprints evidence in orbital period distribution (pile up)
      * Jupiters dominant migration force
  * most jupiters come from WASP
      * heavily affected by selection effects

* Computing sensitivity map
  * Choose stellar and planet sample to maximise efficiency
  * Simulate transit signals
  * Run WASP pipeline and track recovery rate

* Casting underlying distribution
  * Invert observed planets through sensitivity map
  * Peak found at ~4 days
  * Compare with RV planets?

* Consequences...
  * Roche limit consistent with Ford & Rasio
  * Pile up - characteristic to hot Jupiters
  
  
* Todo
  * Make 3 occurrence rate distributions for bright, medium and faint stars using exclusively the correct sensitivity map for each group
  * (after  RV period distribution - unbiased sample - HARPS - very low numbers, look for updated distributions and/or numbers
  * Check if the V magnitude normalisation is the same - normalisation of bright stars and faint stars
  * simulation details:
      3.4 million transits
      125304 solar stars 
      213 wasp fields
