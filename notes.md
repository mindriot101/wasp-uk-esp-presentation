# Outline

* Introduction - background
  * dominant migration method uncertain
  * imprints evidence in orbital period distribution (pile up)
  * jupiters dominant migration force
  * most jupiters come from WASP
  * heavily affected by selection effects

* Computing sensitivity map
  * Choose stellar and planet sample to maximise efficiency
  * Simulate transit signals
  * Run WASP pipeline and track recovery rate

* Casting underlying distribution
  * Invert observed planets through sensitivity map
  * Peak found at ~4 days

* Consequences...
  * Roche limit consistent with Ford & Rasio
  * Pile up - characteristic to hot Jupiters
